# Choosing a domain

## Overview

- Research the best domain for you—but don’t buy it.
- **DO NOT make yourself into a company!** This is your *personal* portfolio website—so include your name.
- `.ca` is highly suggested because it will give you better “Google Juice” for Canadian searches. (Though it does require you to be a Canadian citizen.)
- Try to avoid `.com` if you can for the a similar reason as above: it says “United States”. (Even though technically it doesn’t mean that.)
- Maybe try some of the fancy new domains like `.design` or `.sexy`. (Maybe not `.sexy`)
- Make sure the domain is available for purchase—[**use Hover for your domain research**](https://www.hover.com/) (good prices, Canadian, no shady business practices).
- Be aware of the price of the TLD you’re leasing—there’s a yearly cost.

**You can delay doing this assignment until you get further along in determining your brand—which you’ll be doing in another class.**
